            Jasper is joined by a team of <strong>seven support personnel</strong>, all of whom are committed to helping him perform at the highest level.
            <br/>
            In addition to our rider and support team, we will also be using <strong>two support vehicles</strong> to help us navigate the course and provide us with the necessary
            supplies and support to compete at the highest level. Our goal is to win the <i>Race Across Germany</i>, and we are confident in our ability to do so with
            the right combination of hard work, determination, and team cohesion.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            We are excited to embark on this journey and grateful for the opportunity to compete in this prestigious event!
