            <h2>Our Goals</h2>
            <p>
                As a team, we have set some <strong>ambitious goals</strong> for ourselves as we prepare to compete in the <i>2023 Race Across Germany</i>.
                <br/><br/>
                First and foremost, our main goal is to <strong>win the race</strong>. We have the skills, experience, and determination to succeed, 
                and <strong>we are confident</strong> that with <strong>hard work and good teamwork</strong>, we can achieve this goal.
                <br/><br/>
                In addition to our goal of winning the race, we are also aiming to <strong>qualify for the <i>Race Across America</i></strong>. To qualify, 
                we need to finish the <i>Race Across Germany</i> in under 48 hours, which we believe is a realistic goal for our team.<br/>
                However, we are not content to simply meet the minimum requirements - we are determined to <strong>push ourselves to the limit</strong> and 
                aim to finish in <strong>under 40 hours</strong>.
                <br/><br/>
                We believe that with the right combination of hard work, dedication, and teamwork, we can achieve these goals and make a strong showing in 
                the <i>Race Across Germany</i>.
