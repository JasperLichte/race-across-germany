                I had the opportunity to be a guest on the podcast <strong>"Die zweite Luft"</strong> where I had the pleasure of
                appearing alongside my coach Josephine. We had a great conversation about the mental
                and physical preparation that goes into competing in a race.
                <br />
                We delved into our training routines, the strategies we use to stay
                motivated and focused, and the importance of having a strong support system. We also discussed the challenges
                and obstacles that we have faced and how we have overcome them.
                <br />
                If you're someone who is interested in learning more about how to prepare for a race, then this episode is definitely for you. You can listen
                to the episode on <strong>Spotify.</strong><br />
                I highly recommend giving it a listen, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
